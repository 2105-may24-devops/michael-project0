Hello everyone, my name is Michael, and my project is a recipe manager written in python. 
It allows you to create, edit and save recipes, as well as scale the recipe's ingredients so that someone cooking doesn't have to do mental math on the fly.

I will be running three ansible playbooks to automate the deployment, testing and uninstallation of my program.

First, I will run the setup playbook, which will deploy my program.	
ansible-playbook -i inv.yaml setup.yml 

ansible-playbook -i inv.yaml test.yml
I wrote a bash script, that will run the program with a given set of inputs. The program will then output three files, which will the bash script will check against an answer key

ssh and show VM
./venv/bin/python3 app.py
open test1.json
display
scale 2
display 
metric
display
close : yes
exit

In order to clean up and uninstall he yml file, we can use the cleanup playbook
ansible-playbook -i inv.yaml cleanup.yml 

With that, I have shown how ansible is a flexible way to automate the deployment, testing and also uninstallation of my recipe manager.

Thank you.

break an answer, then redo the test.
ansible-playbook -i inv.yaml test.yml --extra-vars "forza=no"
--extra-vars "base_path=mdtest2"
